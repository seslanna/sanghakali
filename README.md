# sanghakali

Sangha Kali typeface based on Sangha typeface and was optimized for the digital use.

The name of Sangha Kali based on the traditional dance of one of the most orthodox Brahmin caste – Nambudiri. This socio-religious dance is dedicated to Goddess Kali, and save numerous gymnasium techniques (known as 'Kalaris') in ancient Kerala where physical exercises and military training with special emphasis on physical feats and swordsmanship were given.
